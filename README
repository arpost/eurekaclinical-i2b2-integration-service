Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

This is the i2b2 Export Service, a RESTful web service providing the backend
functionality to the i2b2 Data Export plugin. The plugin calls this service to
manage configurations and export data from i2b2. This service communicates with
your i2b2 installation to authenticate users and retrieve PDO data.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 7 and has been deployed
using JBoss 4.2.2 and Tomcat 7. Later versions of Java are expected to work, as
are any other Java application servers.

A relational database system is required for managing user configurations. See
the INSTALL file for database configuration instructions.

i2b2 Export Service uses the Maven build system, available from
http://maven.apache.org. You must install Maven, if you do not already have it,
to work with the source code. Maven 3 is required.

INSTALLATION

Please see the accompanying INSTALL file for installation instructions.
